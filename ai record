Practicum 2: AI Documentation

1) Used Copilot to give me the arrange command to sort my county populations

2) Used Copilot to help change from the viridis scale to one with yellows and 
oranges and to add in a white background for the figures

3) Used Copilot to change from solid colors on my peak points to a gradient and 
remind myself of the the shape code necessary to get a triangle.

4) I created the dataframe for the election years myself, pulling information 
from the data we had, calculating vote percentages and then partisan lean. But I
used Copilot to give me the fact_wrap code to get everything on the same page.
I subsequently adjusted the code to change the colors how I wanted, specify a 
midpoint of 0, and change the labeling.
